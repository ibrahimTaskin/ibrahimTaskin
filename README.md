# Hi, I'm İbrahim 👋 
-  I am a planned worker who loves his job and cares about details. I care a lot about learning new things and improving my skills, and for this purpose, I think it is necessary to benefit from the teaching of human relations. That's why it's so important to me to exchange information with the people on my team.
-  Being aware of the fact that developing ideas keeps the mind, and therefore the body, constantly active, I think it is important to be creative both in business and in personal life.
-  I am always working and striving to do more. I always aim for the best with the philosophy that the success of a person is as much as his effort.
